## Project Name
LeetCodeArrayChallengeProblems
## About
A collection of solved LeetCode problems focused on Arrays and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). This repository contains clean, well-commented JavaScript solutions to popular array-based coding challenges, complete with explanations, time/space complexity analysis, and test cases.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need JavaScript installed on your system.
Node.js is recommended for executing the solutions locally.
No additional libraries or packages are required.
## Features
This LeetCodeArrayChallengeProblems includes these features:

-JavaScript solutions to a variety of LeetCode array problems (Easy, Medium, and Hard).

-Detailed comments explaining the approach and logic.

-Example test cases and edge case handling..

-Organized file structure by problem number and title.

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/LeetCodeArrayChallengeProblems.git`
## Usage
Open the repository in your preferred code editor.
Navigate to the specific problem file (e.g., 01-two-sum.js).
Run the file using Node.js:
node "01-two-sum.js"
Review the console output, explanations, and test results.
Visit the corresponding LeetCode problem link (included in each file) for full problem details and submission.
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

* Master common array manipulation techniques (two pointers, sliding window, hashing, etc.).
* Improve problem-solving speed and code optimization skills.
* Deepen understanding of Big-O complexity analysis.
* Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals in a real-world algorithmic context.
* Prepare effectively for technical coding interviews.

## Contributing
This is primarily a personal learning / portfolio repository, so formal contributions aren’t required. However, if you spot bugs, have project ideas, or want to add improvements, feel free to:
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Submit a pull request Please include clear explanations of your changes and test any new code.
